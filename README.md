# Skills Explained

This is a demo repository to showcase a skill and agent instructions that can be used to write Playwright E2E tests.

Your codebase is different.
Don't copy my skill file and agent instructions exactly.

But steal these patterns:

1. It starts with having your requirements on point. Having a solid first phase will lead to a better plan which will lead to a better implementation in the end.
2. If you see the agent making mistakes over and over on the same issues, e.g. translation keys or accessible roles just point the agent in the right direction by giving the actual file paths.
3. Add self verification. It's really frustrating to get a test which after running doesn't work. By adding in a step for self validation or by using hooks we can get more determinism in an agentic skill.
